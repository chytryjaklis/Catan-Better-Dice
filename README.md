<h1>The goal of project</h1>

The goal of this project was simple — to enhance the board game Catan by replacing traditional dice, which can be very random, with virtual dice that allow for more accurate tracking of results and provide greater control over the gameplay. In the traditional Catan board game, the dice rolls are fully random, and each roll can lead to large fluctuations in the results, which affects the pace of the game and the players' emotions. This project aimed to create an alternative solution that not only replaces the traditional way of rolling dice but also introduces a more thoughtful method of generating results based on weighted probabilities of the possible numbers.

By reducing randomness, this version of the game makes the gameplay more predictable, allowing players to better plan their actions and make strategic decisions. With weights assigned to the dice results, players can adjust their strategies to more stable and logical distributions of outcomes, reducing the frustration associated with unfavorable random results. As a result, the game gains depth, offering players more opportunities to showcase their skills and make more complex decisions. This increases the satisfaction of the game, as the outcome becomes more dependent on strategy, rather than just chance.

<h1>Weight distribution and probabilities</h1>

The weights assigned to each number in this project were determined based on the probability of obtaining certain results when rolling two standard six-sided dice, as well as the actual distribution of results in the Catan game. Below is the table that shows the probability distribution for the weighted dice rolls:
